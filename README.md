# LEGO Timesheet Analytics

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes timesheet data to evaluate workforce utilization and identify inefficiencies in project execution.
The analysis focuses on understanding how working hours are distributed and how they impact overall performance.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
- How does **Productive Utilization (PU)** change over time?
- What is the ratio between **billable and non-billable hours**?
- Are there specific periods or teams with unusually low efficiency?
- What insights can support better workforce planning?

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of employee timesheet records.
- Key fields include:
  - Date
  - Employee / Team
  - Project
  - Billable hours
  - Non-billable hours
- The data used in this repository is **sampled / anonymized** for demonstration purposes.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Approach
1. Data cleaning and validation
2. Calculation of key metrics:
   - Productive Utilization (PU)
   - Billable vs. non-billable ratio
3. Trend analysis over time
4. Identification of abnormal patterns and inefficiencies

## 📊 Key Metrics Explained
- **Productive Utilization (PU)**  
  Percentage of productive working hours compared to total working hours.

- **Billable Ratio**  
  Proportion of billable hours relative to total logged hours.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- PU showed noticeable fluctuations across different periods.
- Certain time ranges had a high proportion of non-billable hours, indicating potential inefficiencies.
- The analysis highlights opportunities for improving resource allocation and workload planning.
